9/20 (day)
    spent hours trying to fix collision
    gonna try objects for spikes instead of tilemap
    IT WORKS

    fixes:
        collision

9/23
    changes:
        spike hitbox and sprite
        spike placement rules

bugs:
    cant jump unless middle is on block (raycast)

    if player falls during pause, cam it in wrong place b/c it doesn't fall

TODO:
    3(?) life max per level, maybe change death counter to health counter
    change placement mode to be when you enter level rather than pressing Q
    way to delete player placed spikes
    have score and health move with cam in pause mode
    !!visual to see where spike is being placed: try opacity of sprite
        have a sprite (never placed) following the camera DONE(broke it)
            worked with rigid body, but that probably wont do grid stuff
            !!!!trying transform.postion, but it can't be seen
        change opacity to be lighter, even lighter if you can't place one there
        to help with lag, maybe only check placement rules if moving
    scoreboard
    display message instead of debug log for incorrect palcement
