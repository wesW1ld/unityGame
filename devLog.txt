9/20 (day)
    spent hours trying to fix collision
    gonna try objects for spikes instead of tilemap
    IT WORKS

    fixes:
        collision

bugs:
    cant jump unless middle is on block (raycast)

    if player falls during pause, cam it in wrong place b/c it doesn't fall

TODO:
    spike placement rules
    3(?) life max per level, maybe change death counter to health counter
    change placement mode to be when you enter level rather than pressing Q
    way to delete player placed spikes
    have score and health move with cam in pause mode
    visual to see where spike is being placed
    spike hitbox to spike, remove background too
    make it so spikes can't be placed on pre-placed block
    scoreboard
